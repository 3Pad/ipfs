# 3Pad Readme

Welcome to the Repository for 3Pad (Sites). This repository contains the published websites by our users, which are then pulled by decentralized services like IPFS and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).


## How It Works
The platform allows users to publish their website and store the content on decentralized networks like IPFS and ICP. When a user publishes their website, the repository pulls the content and stores it in a centralized location, making it accessible and retrievable by decentralized services.



## Requirements
To use this repository, you need to have basic knowledge of decentralized networks like IPFS and ICP. You should also be familiar with Git and have a Github account set up.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/3Pad/sites.git

```

Start using the repository by pulling the published sites from the platform and storing them on decentralized services like IPFS and ICP.
## Decentralized Services
This repository is pulled by Decentralized services, including ICP Canister ID and IPFS Hash. These services allow for the secure and decentralized distribution of your website's files. You can access your website through the following links:

ICP Canister ID: cglrx-3yaaa-aaaap-aaz4a-cai

Current IPNS Hash: ipns://k51qzi5uqu5dj8lwk8uvgap41opu8flbahhl0y4vnzzrqz5ygod3huy26pl04s (Hashes are subject to change)

Please note that in order to view your website through the URL, you will need to have an IPFS gateway or a DApp browser that supports IPFS. To get started, you can use a public IPFS gateway such as https://gateway.ipfs.io/.

ICP RAW URL: https://cglrx-3yaaa-aaaap-aaz4a-cai.ic0.app/

ICP URL: https://3pad.xyz/

IPFS URL: https://3pad.eth.limo/

4Everland IPFS URL: https://ipfs_deploy.4everland.app/
